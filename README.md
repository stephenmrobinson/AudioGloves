# AudioGloves

Code and documents relating to my Senior Project for The University of North Carolina at Asheville

This project provides a means of reading input from a saxophone player through force-sensitive resistors which are read by an Arduino Mega2650 and translating that input into digital audio using Processing and the Minin sound library.
